<h3>My Dumb App</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Outline of canvas object in yellow, background color of canvas is white. This is
	controlled from the HTML level.</li>
	<li>The root interactor bridges the HTML and tropical worlds.  It shifts its content inward by 5 pix, paints background melon colored 
	and rounds its corners</li>
	<li>DumbParent fills its upper left quadrant with cornsilk (sort of brownish) as well as showing
	its border in same color.
	Note that it tries to just do a simple filled rectangle but since its parent (the root interactor)
	set the clipping path with rounded rects, the upper left remains rounded</li>
	<li>Blue rectangles (royal blue and dodger blue) are instances of DumbChild. They just fill
	their entiring bounding rect with a color.</li>
	<li>The red circle is actually a composite.  The Portole type masks its child, whatever it
	is, with an arc. We use a the same DumbLeaf as before, but the masking removes
	the part outside the boundary of Porthole.</li>
	<li>The blue squares and red circle respond clicking by switching from filled
	to stroked.  Note that the clipping rect of the porthole on the round object
	is pretty clearly shown.</li>
	<li>The clickable items respond to mouse focus in the sense that they only
	perform their switch if you click and release within their bounds.</li>
</ul>
